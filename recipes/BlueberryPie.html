        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt and sprinkle over blueberries.</li>
            <li>Line a pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the crust and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide strips. Use the strips to weave a lattice top. Crimp and flute the edges.</li>
